This is the program that I use to test the Pro Micro boards before I ship them. It's the same as ds_driver_master except all the inputs are INPUT_PULLUP, so it works when not connected to the DS. The DS automatically pulls up the inputs when it's on, so it wouldn't be needed to have the Pro Micro board do it, and it risks damaging the DS (Sending a 5V signal to the lower voltage DS).
