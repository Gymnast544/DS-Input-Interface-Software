For setting up the Arduino software:
I'm using the Windows App

Add the Joystick Library:
https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary/tree/version-2.0

Add the Pro Micro board/drivers:
https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide/all

Plug in the Pro Micro
Select the Port
Change the board type from 3V/8Mhz to 5V/16Mhz - IMPORTANT - you can "brick" your Pro Micro board if you forget to do this

You should be able to program the Pro Micro board. DS Driver Master is the program that the Pro Micro board ships with.

I (Gymnast544) am not liable if you brick your Pro Micro board.
