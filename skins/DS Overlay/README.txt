This awesome DS Skin/Layout was made by MyLittleWalrus. If you just want to use it for the bottom screen skin, just use the DS background.

This skin also has a layout associated with it. You can use the ds layout.png image and put the input display in the bottom left of the screen. Then just put the capture card output over the screen outlines.

There is a blank background which is a green background. You can also use this background along with the ds layout.png layout, and it should line up fine.
